## 4. Pricing Experimentation Ideas

> **Note:** All pricing experiments require explicit authorization and must comply with TrustLanguageLock.md

### Potential Experiments (Not Approved)

#### A. Dynamic Availability Messaging

- Risk: May violate "calm confidence" brand principle
- Recommendation: Proceed with caution, if at all

#### B. Package Bundling
- Test: "Complete Wellness Package" (Spa + Fitness day pass)
- Risk: Complexity in booking flow
- Recommendation: Consider for Phase 2 roadmap

#### C. Membership Tier Optimization
- Test: Different tier names, benefit ordering
- Risk: Confusion for existing members
- Recommendation: A/B test on new visitors only

#### D. Gift Card Bonus Value
- Test: "Buy $100, get $110 in value"
- Risk: Margin impact, expectation setting
- Recommendation: Seasonal promotion only

### Pricing Experimentation Rules
1. Never show different prices to same user
2. Maintain price consistency across sessions
3. Document all experiments in audit log
4. Minimum 2-week test duration
5. Statistical significance required before conclusions
